<hr> or <div class="hr">?

‚ùó Fix font size on mobile
    (on the devtools emulator at least, it often appears weird.)
    Test the site on a real mobile device
    
    (
        might have been a fluke resulting from to an old issue with a very long horizontal scrollbar
        on the projects page due to a fixed project container width
    )
    
Learn why spaces within path/file names are not valid HTML5

All:
    Soon:
        Re-learn why flex is used instead of grid for one of the 2x sticky design patterns
            (header content footer, then within content there is another for the date modified paragraph)
        Fix the horizontal scroll bar issue
            (probably a fixed unit somewhere)
        ‚úÖ Use BEM
        üöß Use REM units
        Standardize all sizing and font units to common multiples

Projects:
    Of utmost importance:
        ‚úÖ Add bandwidth & dpi responsive project images
            I could just learn JavaScript and let Astro do the automatic
                ... conversion instead. One day I'd still need to re-learn
                ... srcset and <picture> when I apply this pattern to
                ... user uploaded images.
            Update: Used a generator website. Learn srcset & <picture>/<source> again to double check and understand completely.
        ‚úÖ Full code review and remove / update as fit
    Soon:
        Fix tooltip script's Content Security Policy issue
        Fix use of em units
    Later:
        Improve accessibility for tooltip

Base:
    Soon:
        ‚ùó Add bandwidth & dpi responsive headshot image
        Fix the introduction-sequence "software developer" subtext accessibility issue
        Think about and adjust subheader ordering if needed

Index:
    Later:
        Fix messy index font size dependent on viewport width

Attributions:
    Later:
        Fix attributions CSS link hover weird hacks, list width weird hack to achieve link effect
        

* We will need something like Webpack for this:
* Webpack can also automate srcset and automatic DPI downsizing for responsive images.

üöß (big) Improve CI/CD pipeline
    include assets and html under src/
    
    NPM Script Steps:
        1. Notice change to assets | html under src/
        2. Reflect update/move/delete change to public/
        
        3. Validate HTML via the w3c validator.
           * Raise a pull request error if validation fails
        
        6. Lint SCSS files
           * Raise an error upon merge if SCSS Linter raises an error   
        
        4. Notice change to SCSS files under src/
        5. Build SCSS file if it is updated.
           Move CSS output if source file is moved.
           Delete CSS output if source file is removed.
           
           * Raise an error upon merge if SCSS errors
           * .gitignore public/static/css for commits since the CI/CD pipeline will do it for me
           
        6. Validate CSS output (probably not necessary since SCSS will error if it's invalid)
           
        7. Lint JS files
           * Raise a pull request error if JS Linter raises an error

        8. Strip HTML/CSS/JS of comments
        9. Minify HTML/CSS/JS

        10. Integrate this whenever a pull request is merged into any branch.
        11. Integrate this whenever a commit is made to any branch.
        12. Integrate this for my local environment whenever I edit a file
            * install an editor JS Linter, SCSS Linter
            * SCSS --watch command + source move/delete reflection to public functionality
            * HTML/CSS validation functionality
    
    
## Completed

‚úÖ Use SCSS variables for breakpoint values

‚úÖ Add a favicon
    Add favicon choices for lots of different devices
    Old versions of iOS may require apple-touch-icon links,
    but they may also use the root's favicon.ico.
    If something like an old Roku TV stick requires an apple touch icon I'll add it for fun :)

‚úÖ Move the super "Zowie Beha" & subtext "software developer" to be under
    ... the headshot image at the center of the screen.
    
‚úÖ Validate all HTML documents

‚úÖ Remove JS DOMContentLoaded event listener since we now defer.

‚úÖ Use an IIFE for an anonymous scope instead.

‚úÖ Make site cross-compatible with older MacOS desktops using old Safari browser versions.
    ‚úÖ Figure out which version of MacOS / Safari the site breaks at.
    ‚úÖ SCSS's nested style feature should help with outdated browser cross-compatibility
       I think this may have solved it?
       In addition to great architectural changes.
       
       ‚ùìHow is grid support in Safari version 15.6?
       Tested via Playwright: It works as written so it's good.
       
‚úÖ homepage fix uncentered socials on mobile

‚úÖ attributions uncentered list

‚úÖ projects won't shrink for mobile
    (it used fixed units for sizing that were too large on mobile)

‚úÖ Projects are off-center a bit at a small laptop screen width
    (the project container used fixed units for its width)

‚úÖ Ensure that favicon is DPI, device & network responsive

‚úÖ remove img/favicon* files that are unused

‚úÖ remove projects-old.html in bem-conversion

‚úÖ merge main into dev, main into bem-conversion with --rebase

‚úÖ checkout an old version of the site and test with playwright/browserling

‚úÖ Implement Open Graph Protocol
