    fix messy index font size dependent on viewport width

Attributions
    fix attributions CSS link hover weird hacks, list width weird hack to achieve link effect

    ‚ùó Code review and remove / update as fit

Improve CI/CD pipeline
    include assets and html under src/
    
    NPM Script Steps:
        1. Notice change to assets | html under src/
        2. Reflect update/move/delete change to public/
        
        3. Validate HTML via the w3c validator.
           * Raise a pull request error if validation fails
        
        6. Lint SCSS files
           * Raise an error upon merge if SCSS Linter raises an error   
        
        4. Notice change to SCSS files under src/
        5. Build SCSS file if it is updated.
           Move CSS output if source file is moved.
           Delete CSS output if source file is removed.
           
           * Raise an error upon merge if SCSS errors
           * .gitignore public/static/css for commits since the CI/CD pipeline will do it for me
           
        6. Validate CSS output (probably not necessary since SCSS will error if it's invalid)
           
        7. Lint JS files
           * Raise a pull request error if JS Linter raises an error

        8. Strip HTML/CSS/JS of comments
        9. Minify HTML/CSS/JS

        10. Integrate this whenever a pull request is merged into any branch.
        11. Integrate this whenever a commit is made to any branch.
        12. Integrate this for my local environment whenever I edit a file
            * install an editor JS Linter, SCSS Linter
            * SCSS --watch command + source move/delete reflection to public functionality
            * HTML/CSS validation functionality
    
    
## Completed

‚úÖ Use SCSS variables for breakpoint values

‚úÖ Add a favicon
    Add favicon choices for lots of different devices
    Old versions of iOS may require apple-touch-icon links,
    but they may also use the root's favicon.ico.
    If something like an old Roku TV stick requires an apple touch icon I'll add it for fun :)

‚úÖ Move the super "Zowie Beha" & subtext "software developer" to be under
    ... the headshot image at the center of the screen.
    
‚úÖ Validate all HTML documents

‚úÖ Remove JS DOMContentLoaded event listener since we now defer.

‚úÖ Use an IIFE for an anonymous scope instead.
