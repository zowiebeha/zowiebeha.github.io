CName sometimes works when an alias doesn't, when one wants
to point the root hostname to a different hostname

Servers have CORs policies, which must be updated
in order for external domains to receive content from them.

It entails the HOST header of the request.

I rent a domain (zowie.blog) and point a CName record to zowiebeha.github.io
I visit zowie.blog
the CName resolves zowiebeha.github.io to its IP, and returns the response from github

github could respond in one of the following ways:

❌returns a response without any checks
    security risk, as the external site could iframe the site and make a typosquatted thing to
    steal credentials

❌returns a response only by checking that a CORs entry exists in their records
    upon request to each page.
    I guess they need load balancing and so they must use a proxy rather than
    perform the CORs check on each subdomain? internal network structure doesn't permit this

sees my HOST header from their proxy, directs me to either a 404
    if CORs isn't enabled for my HOST in their system to map my host to one of their urls,
    or to the correct page if someting is mapped to one of their urls.
    
    ^ shouldn't be a thing without verification, as anyone can steal my stuff.
    should be disallowed. WTF github?

sees my HOST header, and knows I own the domain because it always requires
TXT record verification, and then directs me to either a 404
    if CORs isn't enabled for my HOST in their system to map my host to one of their urls,
    or to the correct page if someting is mapped to one of their urls.

why is based on the HOST having proper CORs privileges, and a hashmap of host:code_base?
why isn't it based on the HOST having proper CORs privileges, and what page the HOST wants to access?
    I guess because then the HOST could iframe anything, steal credentials, typosquat, etc.
