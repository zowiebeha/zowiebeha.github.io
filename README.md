## Roadmap

Integrate Node.js build tooling, testing with Jest, and use Github Actions to automate these processes.
I might integrate some linting features into the projects' git hooks .

There are some stray `em` units where there could be `rem` units, which will need conversion based on the font-size of the nearest parent with an explicit font-size.

Integrate backend functionality with Express.js or C#/ASP.NET with a SQL Server database.
This will include a technical/personal blog to write about my life, publish tutorials, and more :)
