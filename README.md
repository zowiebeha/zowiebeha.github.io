# ‚ùóNote to readers:
The code is bad. It's not maintainable, and requires a component framework like React or Angular to truly shine. BEM/Vanilla CSS `<link>`s don't suffice, as they don't offer mixins nor non-blocking module support. I plan to re-work this via these technologies Soon..

# Roadmap

I plan to revamp this website to have a more maintainable codebase,
with graphic design principles applied.

It's pretty messy and not very maintainable at the moment. There aren't many components used, and it's em units all the way down for the most part without regard to rule font-size. I'm so excited to make it super epic soon...

I also plan to create a technical/personal blog to write about my life, tutorials, and more :)
