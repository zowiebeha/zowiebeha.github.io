# Roadmap

It's pretty messy at the moment.
Flex is used throughout and while it works, it adds a lot of noisy properties. Grid is a lot more compact syntactically.
Additionally, BEM naming isn't used a lot. The project also uses `em` units all the way down for the most part with little regard to parent font-size.

I plan to fix these issues, and one day to create a technical/personal blog to write about my life, publish tutorials, and more :)
